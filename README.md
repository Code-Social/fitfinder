# 🎯 Profile Rank (FitFinder) – Find opportunities Meant for You

Welcome to **Profile Rank**, a smart and community-driven platform where you can discover **global scholarships, conferences, hackathons, research programs, apprenticeships, and more**, all based on your profile.

> Think of it as a chill version of LinkedIn, but focused only on non-job opportunities that help you grow. We help you figure out where you're most likely to get accepted, based on your skills, goals, and even your LinkedIn profile. You'll get suggestions from the UI when you submit your profile, and community members can comment on opportunities and share their experiences.

## 🌍 What Can You Do with Profile Rank?

✨ **Discover Opportunities**  
Search or browse through opportunities curated by other users:

- 🎓 Scholarships
- 🧑‍🔬 Research Programs
- 🧑‍🏫 Apprenticeships
- 🧑‍💻 Hackathons
- 🌎 Conferences

... and see if you're a good fit or what you can do to become one.

🧠 **Find Your Fit**  
Once you create your **FitProfile**, the system will show you how well you match with each opportunity using a percentage based on your:

- Skills
- Education & GPA
- Location
- LinkedIn Profile
- Past experience

💬 **Read Success Stories**  
Each opportunity can feature real prep tips, success stories, and checklists shared by people who got selected.

✅ **Submit New Opportunities**  
Logged-in users can submit global opportunities to help others grow. Once approved by admins, they'll be featured on the platform.

🔖 **Bookmark and Track**  
Save opportunities, view past submissions, and help others in any way you can.
